  To use the application, users open the landing page and click "Get Started" which redirects them to the notes page.  There the user can see all previously saved notes' titles in the lefthand column. Clicking on a saved note title will populate the saved note text and title in the right hand portion of the page where it can be edited and saved. Users can generate a new note by clicking the plus button in the top right of the page. Once both the note title and note field contain information, a save button will appear next to the plus sign in the top right. Clicking the save button will add the note to the list of saved titles on the left.
